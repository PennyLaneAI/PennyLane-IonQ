Once the PennyLane-IonQ plugin is installed, the two provided IonQ devices can be accessed
straight away in PennyLane, without the need to import any additional packages.

Devices
=======

PennyLane-IonQ provides two IonQ devices for PennyLane:

.. devicegalleryitem::
    :name: 'ionq.simulator'
    :description: Ideal noiseless trapped-ion simulator.
    :link: devices.html#simulator

.. devicegalleryitem::
    :name: 'ionq.qpu'
    :description: Trapped-ion QPU
    :link: devices.html#qpu

.. raw:: html

    <div style='clear:both'></div>
    </br>

Both devices support the same operations, including IonQ's
custom :class:`.XX`, :class:`.YY`, and :class:`.ZZ` gates.

Remote backend access
=====================

The user will need access credentials for the IonQ platform in order to
use these remote devices. These credentials should be provided to PennyLane via a
`configuration file or environment variable <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/configuration.html>`_.
Specifically, the variable ``IONQ_API_KEY`` must contain a valid access key for IonQ's online platform.
