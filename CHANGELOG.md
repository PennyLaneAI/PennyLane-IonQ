### New features since last release

* Application of debiasing and sharpening for error mitigation is made available, with parameters set on device initialization. Error mitigation strategies that 
  need to be set at runtime are defined in the `error_mitigation` dictionary (currently a single strategy, `debias`, is available). Whether or not to
  apply sharpening to the returned results is set via the parameter `sharpen`. A device using debiasing and sharpening to mitigate errors can be initialized as:
  
  ```python
  import pennylane as qml

  dev = qml.device("ionq.qpu", wires=2, error_mitigation={"debias": True}, sharpen=True)
  ```

  For more details, see the [IonQ Guide on sharpening and debiasing](https://ionq.com/resources/debiasing-and-sharpening), or refer to the publication <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.07233.pdf>

  the PennyLane device normalizes them to higher precision.
